WEEK 1 TASKS - Python Basics:
1. Write a program that, between two numbers, prints the one with higher value
- Sample values: 5, 87
- pected Result : 87
2. Write a program that prints True or False whether a number is within 1000 or 2000(both upper and lower limit included).
- Sample value: 1303
- Expected Result : True
3. Write a program that accepts an integer (n) and computes the value of n+nn+nnn.
- Sample value of n is 5
- Expected Result : 615
4. Write a program that calculates number of seconds to pass based on days input
- Sample value: 5 days
- Expected Result : 432000 seconds
5. Write a program to display the current date and time.
- Sample Output : 2022-01-30 07:34:14
6. Write a program that calculates the length of a string.
- Sample value: I am my moon
- Expected Result : 12
7. Write a program to find word in a string.
- Sample string: Today was a good day.
- Sample word: good
- Expected Result : True
8. Write a program to sum all the numbers in a list.
- Sample list: [2, 2, 5, 1]
- Expected Result : 10
9. Write a program to remove duplicates from a list.
- Sample list: [2, 2, 5, 1]
- Expected Result : [2, 5, 1]
10. Write a program that creates sentences from the words in a list.
- Sample list: ['In', 'the', 'last', 'episode', 'of', 'Breaking', 'Bad']
- Expected Result : 'In the last episode of Breaking Bad'
11. Write a program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included).
12. Write a program which iterates the integers from 1 to 50. For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".
13. Write a program that accepts a word from the user and reverse it.
- Sample word: 'DZONI'
- Expected Result : 'INOZD'
14. Write a program to convert temperatures to and from celsius, fahrenheit.
[ Formula : c/5 = f-32/9 [ where c = temperature in celsius and f = temperature in fahrenheit ]
- Expected Output :
  60°C is 140 in Fahrenheit
  45°F is 7 in Celsius
15. Write a program to check the validity of password input by users.
Validation :
- At least 1 letter between [a-z] and 1 letter between [A-Z].
- At least 1 number between [0-9].
- At least 1 character from [$#@].
- Minimum length 6 characters.
- Maximum length 16 characters.



WEEK 2 TASKS - Functions:
1. Write a function that takes one argument. If the function receives value equal to "yes", it should return "Shutting down". Alternatively, if value is equal to "no", then the function should return "Shutdown aborted". Finally, if gets anything other than those inputs, the function should return "Sorry".
2.  Write a function that accepts 2 arguments, first one is any given data type, second one is user input value. Function should check if the input value satisfies the data type condition of the first argument.
3. Write a function that checks whether a passed string is palindrome or not.
Note: A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.
Examples:   'Ana voli Milovana',  'madam',  'U Rimu umiru',  'idu ljeta, pate ljudi'  itd.
4. Write a function to check whether a string is a pangram or not.
Note : Pangrams are words or sentences containing every letter of the alphabet at least once.
For example : "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
5. Write a function that invokes a lambda/anonymous function after specific milliseconds. 


WEEK 3 TASK - Object-Oriented programming:
Following task is example inspired by game developers using Object-Oriented Programming. Create Witcher 3 fight simulator using OOP(use all 4 oop principles i.e Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation and Abstraction). Program should showcase fight between Witcher and any monster that "appears" in the wild. Any type of monster MUST have following attributes: name, hit_points and lives, among others. Also each monster must be capable to take or deal damage among other actions. Little hint, make "Enemy" superclass and start from there.

Choose one of the following monster types:
- Vampires(Superclass)
 1. Higher Vampire(Subclass)
 2. Bruxa(Subclass)
 3. Ekimmara(Subclass)
 4. Katakan(Subclass)

- Relicts(Superclass)
 1. Crones(Subclass)
 2 .Leshen(Subclass)
 3. Fiend(Subclass)

- Elementa(Superclass)
 1. Ice Elemental(Subclass)
 2. Fire Elemental(Subclass)
 3. Earth Elemental(Subclass)
